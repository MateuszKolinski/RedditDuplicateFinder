# Reddit Duplicate Finder
Created by Mateusz Koli≈Ñski (MateuszPKolinski@gmail.com)

A Python script for finding and reporting duplicate Reddit submissions as a moderator.

Fetches all submission titles on a specific subreddit via pushshift and then matches them with the current submission stream.

If names match, sends a report with previous submission's IDs for moderators to check and act upon.
